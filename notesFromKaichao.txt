INL SPD always are at 2Hz
TP 1 and 2
CEA at 2Hz as well as INL SPDs

TP 3 
CEA at 4Hz
TP 4
CEA at 10Hz
TP 5 6 7 8
CEA at 20Hz

Use normalization in TP 4

Legend for SPGD same as TREAT slides
____
CEA_SPGD1
CEA_SPGD2
INL_SPGD1
INL_SPGD2

FOR TREAT Specific Data

Generate 6 plots
2 for MPFD
4 for SPND (SPGD)
- handle 1kHz issue, large data size

Use ARCS system to standardize detector schema
State same time that ARCS is ~600kW, and for ~200kW. Use to base plots for all detectors.

Some detectors have x1000 scaling factor to reduce output during reactor pulse behavior.

Show the use of the scaling factor, putting different peaks together to make predictions on the pulse.
